This repository contains code and resources related to the determination of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) loss in astronauts due to microgravity and the impact of different multiple myeloma cancer proliferation rates on BMD. This project is part of the Quantitative Physiology class, where we explore the application of quantitative techniques to understand physiological phenomena.


The main objective of this project is to analyze the impact of microgravity on Bone Mineral Density in astronauts and to study how various proliferation rates of multiple myeloma cancer affect BMD loss. The code in this repository facilitates the simulation and analysis of these scenarios.


The Microgravity_Only_Code includes the base equation and shows the effects of microgravity only as based off of Wang 2011. The Microgravity_and_Myeloma_Code shows the addition of the four proliferation rates and the effect this has on the decay rate for the base equation by finding the OCa and OCb rate changes based on the different proliferation rates. Finally, the TScore_Code calculates the T Score based on microgravity only BMD loss and microgravity plus myeloma BMD loss and then returns the appropriate range at which the T score falls into.
