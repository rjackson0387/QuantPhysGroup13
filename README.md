# QuantPhysGroup13

This repository contains code and resources related to the determination of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) loss in astronauts due to microgravity and the impact of different multiple myeloma cancer proliferation rates on BMD. This project is part of the Quantitative Physiology class, where we explore the application of quantitative techniques to understand physiological phenomena.


The main objective of this project is to analyze the impact of microgravity on Bone Mineral Density in astronauts and to study how various proliferation rates of multiple myeloma cancer affect BMD loss. The code in this repository facilitates the simulation and analysis of these scenarios.
